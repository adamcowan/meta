contains two vague categories of code: utilities and snippets

* __utilities__: clever single-file solutions
  * tvsort: tries to automatically sort tv shows into an existing folder structure
  * permute: builds chains of similar characters and permutes possible combinations.

* __snippets__: batteries not included
  * python
     * threadpool: decorator capable of transparently threading calls to one or more functions, with the ability to store the return values for consumption.
